In order for your party to become a crew member of a ship you must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Assign ownership of the ship actor to players that are part of the ship.</li>\n<li>In the character or NPC sheets, go to the 'Bio' tab and open the Crew Position drop down</li>\n<li>This list is populated via all the available ships this player has access to as well as generic crew positions without a ship name attached to it. Select the ship name and position you wish for this member to be assigned to.</li>\n<li>Back on the ship sheet under the crew tab, this character will now be visible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you assign a character to a generic position, it is simply for informational purposes only and doesn't attach them to any specific ship.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Modules</h2>\n<p>Ship Modules come in 3 different types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Required</li>\n<li>Optional</li>\n<li>Weapon</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Required</strong> and <strong>Optional </strong>are purely for GM informational purposes. Weapon modules display more information in the ship sheet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can toggle a module to be enabled or disabled.</p>\n<p>For weapon modules, in the ship sheet you can directly edit the quantity in the module tab in case you wish to manage ammunition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To creat a new module you go to the Items directory and select 'create new item' and&nbsp; choose <code>shipModule</code>. Once created you can drag and drop it onto the ship.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Energy Point Tokens</h2>\n<p>Energy points are typically managed by either the GM or the engineer on the crew.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The energy points bar in the middle of the ship sheet let's you set the maximum number of EP a ship can hold at any given time. If your ship requires more than 10, there is a sytem setting (game settings --&gt; system settings --&gt; Maximum Allowed Energy Points) that let's you edit this boundary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each crew member in the crew tab has an energy point bar beneath their portrait. Once the max is set, the GM or the player controlling the engineer can click on any of the energy bars below crew portraits and distribute EP to them. This depletes the available EP from the ship's main EP bar. Once the ship's EP bar is completely depleted no more EP can be distributed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can lower the EP below a crew member to return EP back to the ship's pool.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have EP distributed between crew members and then change the maximum EP of the ship (via clicking on the ship's main EP bar), all crew member EP are return to the ship so you can re-distribute again.</p>"}
